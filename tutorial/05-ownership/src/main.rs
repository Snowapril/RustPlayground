//! memory is managed through a system of ownership with a set of rules that the compiler checks at compile time.

//! Ownership Rules
// Each value in Rust has a variable thatâ€™s called its owner.
// There can only be one owner at a time.
// When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.
fn main() {
    {
        let s = "hello";
    } // s is no longer valid.
    // println!("{}", s); impossible.

    let mut s = String::from("Hello");
    s.push_str(", World!");
    println!("{}", s);

    let s2 = "sinjihng"; // string literal

    // Rust takes a different path: the memory is automatically returned once the variable that owns it goes out of scope. 
    {
        let mut s = String::from("SNOWAPRIL");
    } // s is automatically deallocated because it goes out of scope.

    // assign 10 to x and copy the value of the x to y.
    let x = 10;
    let y = x; 

    // string is allocated in heap and it's pointer is stored in String class and save to s1.
    // "MOVE" s1 to s2. thus, s1 is no longer valid.
    let s1 = String::from("sinjihng");
    let s2 = s1;
    // println!("{}", s1); this is error.

    // Deep copy
    let s1 = String::from("sinjihng");

    // the value will be cleaned up by drop unless the data has been moved to be owned by another variable.
